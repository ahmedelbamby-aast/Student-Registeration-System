# Tasks: Identity and Account Lifecycle

**Status**: Planned only. Do not execute until human approval.
**Inputs**: spec.md, requirements.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api.md

## Phase 1 - Approval and Contracts

- [ ] T001 Obtain human approval for SPEC-007.
- [ ] T002 Reconfirm upstream dependency versions and institutional policy approvals.
- [ ] T003 Freeze the reviewed data and API contract for the implementation sprint.

## Phase 2 - User Stories

- [ ] T004 [P] [US1] Add the future failing acceptance test for AC-1 (FR-1, FR-4) under tests/acceptance/007-identity-account-lifecycle/.
- [ ] T005 [US1] Implement AC-1 only after approval, using the module paths declared in plan.md.
- [ ] T006 [P] [US2] Add the future failing acceptance test for AC-2 (FR-2) under tests/acceptance/007-identity-account-lifecycle/.
- [ ] T007 [US2] Implement AC-2 only after approval, using the module paths declared in plan.md.
- [ ] T008 [P] [US3] Add the future failing acceptance test for AC-3 (FR-3, FR-4, FR-6) under tests/acceptance/007-identity-account-lifecycle/.
- [ ] T009 [US3] Implement AC-3 only after approval, using the module paths declared in plan.md.
- [ ] T010 [P] [US4] Add the future failing acceptance test for AC-4 (FR-7) under tests/acceptance/007-identity-account-lifecycle/.
- [ ] T011 [US4] Implement AC-4 only after approval, using the module paths declared in plan.md.
- [ ] T012 [P] [US5] Add the future failing acceptance test for AC-5 (FR-5, FR-8, FR-9) under tests/acceptance/007-identity-account-lifecycle/.
- [ ] T013 [US5] Implement AC-5 only after approval, using the module paths declared in plan.md.

## Phase 3 - Quality and Release

- [ ] T090 Run unit, integration, concurrency, authorization, accessibility, and performance checks required by requirements.md.
- [ ] T091 Verify every FR and AC has passing evidence and no capacity or authorization invariant regressed.
- [ ] T092 Complete product-owner, policy-owner, QA, security, and operations release gates.

## Requirement Traceability Reference

- FR-1: Student login MUST accept normalized University ID and password.
- FR-2: Student activation MUST only claim a pre-imported student record after
  verification through an approved institutional factor.
- FR-3: Staff MUST use one login and MUST NOT self-register.
- FR-4: The server MUST issue role claims and enforce endpoint/resource
  policies for Student/Admin/Lecturer/TeachingAssistant.
- FR-5: The system MUST support secure recovery, lockout, logout, and
  invalidate-all-sessions.
- FR-6: Staff MUST use MFA before production.
- FR-7: Authentication MUST use a same-origin Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookie
  plus antiforgery for mutations.
- FR-8: Long-lived tokens MUST NOT be stored in browser local storage.
- FR-9: Login/activation/recovery MUST be rate-limited and safely audited.

No task is complete and no implementation file has been created.
