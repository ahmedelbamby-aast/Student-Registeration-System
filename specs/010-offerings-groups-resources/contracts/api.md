# API Contract: Offerings, Groups, and Resources

## Feature Contract

```typescript
interface GroupDto {
  id: string;
  groupCode: string;
  capacity: number;
  enrolledCount: number;
  registrationPaused: boolean;
  state: "draft" | "published" | "closed" | "cancelled";
  staff: Array<{ role: "Lecturer" | "TeachingAssistant"; name: string }>;
  meetings: Array<{
    dayOfWeek: number;
    startLocal: string;
    endLocal: string;
    roomCode: string;
    location: string;
  }>;
  rowVersion: string;
}
interface OfferingMutationRequest {
  expectedOfferingRowVersion: string;
  expectedGroupRowVersions: Record<string, string>;
  previewToken?: string;
  clientRequestId: string;
}
```

Endpoints: GET /api/offerings/{id}, GET /api/groups/{id}, POST
/api/admin/offerings, PUT /api/admin/groups/{id}, POST
/api/admin/offerings/{id}/validate, and POST
/api/admin/offerings/{id}/publish.
Every group-state, capacity, meeting, room, and staff-assignment mutation
requires the owning group rowversion. Retryable create/publish uses
clientRequestId; stale resources return 409 GROUP_CHANGED,
RESOURCE_CONFLICT, or IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED without partial publication.

## Shared Rules

- All protected operations require server-validated authentication and role/data-scope authorization.
- Validation errors use stable codes and actionable, privacy-safe messages.
- Mutation requests support idempotency or concurrency tokens where retries can duplicate or contest a write.
- Dates use ISO 8601 and the server-configured academic term.
- Lists are bounded and paginated; filtering and sorting are server-side.
