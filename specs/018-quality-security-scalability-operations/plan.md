# Implementation Plan: Quality Security Scalability and Operations

**Branch**: 018-quality-security-scalability-operations | **Date**: 2026-07-12 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Status**: Planning complete; implementation is not authorized.

## Summary

Deliver Quality Security Scalability and Operations inside the modular monolith while keeping server-side academic and authorization decisions authoritative.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C# / .NET 10
**Primary Dependencies**: ASP.NET Core, Blazor WebAssembly, Entity Framework Core, LINQ
**Storage**: SQL Server with Code First migrations
**Testing**: xUnit plus API, integration, concurrency, accessibility, and browser tests as applicable
**Project Type**: Web application with hosted WebAssembly client and server API
**Performance Goals**: Governed by SPEC-018 and feature NFRs
**Constraints**: Atomic writes, WCAG 2.2 AA, stateless APIs, no client-authoritative decisions
**Scale/Scope**: Registration-peak horizontal scaling; bounded and paginated queries

## Constitution Check

- PASS: Git ownership is reserved for Ahmed ELbamby.
- PASS: Requirements, acceptance scenarios, and tasks use stable traceability identifiers.
- PASS: The design remains a simple modular monolith.
- PASS: Security, policy, schedule, capacity, and term decisions remain server-authoritative.
- PASS: Accessibility, scalability, concurrency, and observability requirements are retained.
- PASS: No application source code or migration is created by this planning phase.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR-1: Support planning baseline of 25,000 accounts and 5,000 concurrent
  authenticated sessions, pending S0 rebaseline.
- NFR-2: Support 75 submissions/s for 10 min, 200/s for 60 s, and 300 read/s.
- NFR-3: Catalogue p95 <= 300 ms; commit p95 <= 2 s; optimizer p95 <= 500 ms
  for the approved workload.
- NFR-4: Zero overbooking, duplicate active offering enrollment, and partial
  atomic submission.
- NFR-5: Availability MUST be 99.9% during announced registration windows.
- NFR-6: Unexpected server failure rate MUST be < 0.1% at target load.
- NFR-7: RPO MUST be <= 5 minutes and RTO <= 1 hour.
- NFR-8: Critical flows MUST meet WCAG 2.2 AA.
- NFR-9: Eligibility/conflict/capacity code SHOULD reach >= 90% branch
  coverage; coverage never replaces behavior tests.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violation or distributed component is proposed. Additional infrastructure requires measured evidence and an approved amendment.
