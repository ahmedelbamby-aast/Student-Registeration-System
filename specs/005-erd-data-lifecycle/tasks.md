# Tasks: ERD and Data Lifecycle

**Status**: Planned only. Do not execute until human approval.
**Inputs**: spec.md, requirements.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api.md

## Phase 1 - Approval and Contracts

- [ ] T001 Obtain human approval for SPEC-005.
- [ ] T002 Reconfirm upstream dependency versions and institutional policy approvals.
- [ ] T003 Freeze the reviewed data and API contract for the implementation sprint.

## Phase 2 - User Stories

- [ ] T004 [P] [US1] Add the future failing acceptance test for AC-1 (FR-2) under tests/acceptance/005-erd-data-lifecycle/.
- [ ] T005 [US1] Implement AC-1 only after approval, using the module paths declared in plan.md.
- [ ] T006 [P] [US2] Add the future failing acceptance test for AC-2 (FR-3) under tests/acceptance/005-erd-data-lifecycle/.
- [ ] T007 [US2] Implement AC-2 only after approval, using the module paths declared in plan.md.
- [ ] T008 [P] [US3] Add the future failing acceptance test for AC-3 (FR-5) under tests/acceptance/005-erd-data-lifecycle/.
- [ ] T009 [US3] Implement AC-3 only after approval, using the module paths declared in plan.md.
- [ ] T010 [P] [US4] Add the future failing acceptance test for AC-4 (FR-1, FR-4, FR-6, FR-8) under tests/acceptance/005-erd-data-lifecycle/.
- [ ] T011 [US4] Implement AC-4 only after approval, using the module paths declared in plan.md.
- [ ] T012 [P] [US5] Add the future failing acceptance test for AC-5 (FR-7) under tests/acceptance/005-erd-data-lifecycle/.
- [ ] T013 [US5] Implement AC-5 only after approval, using the module paths declared in plan.md.

## Phase 3 - Quality and Release

- [ ] T090 Run unit, integration, concurrency, authorization, accessibility, and performance checks required by requirements.md.
- [ ] T091 Verify every FR and AC has passing evidence and no capacity or authorization invariant regressed.
- [ ] T092 Complete product-owner, policy-owner, QA, security, and operations release gates.

## Requirement Traceability Reference

- FR-1: EF Core Code First migrations MUST define the approved ERD.
- FR-2: Student University ID, course/program/term codes, group codes, active
  enrollment, and submission idempotency MUST have database uniqueness guards.
- FR-3: Capacity and time/date bounds MUST have database check constraints.
- FR-4: Mutable aggregate roots MUST use SQL Server rowversion where specified.
- FR-5: Transcript attempts, published policies, decision snapshots, and audit
  events MUST preserve historical meaning.
- FR-6: Enrollment/group references MUST guarantee the group belongs to the
  selected offering.
- FR-7: Production migrations MUST be reviewed scripts/bundles, not automatic
  startup migrations.
- FR-8: Data provenance MUST be recorded for imported academic/catalogue data.

No task is complete and no implementation file has been created.
